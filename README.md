# Learning Pytorch
This is the repository for me while I'm learning Pytorch and to keep track.
All the codes are in ipynb notebooks. So, if you want to the code you have to download the files and open in a jupyter lab/notebook, for example.

# 1- simple regression
The files are in the folder 1Regression

# 2- Classification
Files in 2Classification
